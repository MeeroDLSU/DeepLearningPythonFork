## Overview
This fork is for a final project requirement in NUMMETS. It uses the neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com 
integrated scripts for Python 3.5.2 made originally by Michael Nielsen. Our topic for NUMMETS is to
modify a NN that uses centered finite difference and compare its performance with a Backpropagation NN.

A simplified NN for both backpropagation and centered finite difference is also tested.


The files that we added are run_program.ipynb, updated_network_v2.py, and the simple neural networks.py
# To start our Centered finite difference modified NN, run the notebook named run_program.ipynb
# To start our Simple NN, run simple neural networks.py
