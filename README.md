## Overview
This fork is for a final project requirement in NUMMETS. It uses the neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com 
integrated scripts for Python 3.5.2 made originally by Michael Nielsen

The files that we added are run_program.ipynb, updated_network_v2.py, and the simple neural networks.py
# To start, run the notebook named run_program.ipynb
